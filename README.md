# PulseCheckAI
Project Overview
PulseCheck AI is a full-stack attendance management solution built to bridge the gap between administrative oversight and employee well-being. By integrating AI-assisted verification and real-time geofencing, the platform ensures high compliance while maintaining a modern, transparent relationship between staff and management.

Core Innovation Pillars
AI-Driven Intelligence: Features an "AI Lateness Coach" to provide constructive feedback and automated AI verification for medical sick notes, reducing administrative manual labor.

Contextual Reliability: Replaces traditional "hours clocked" with Pulse Scores and Reliability Metrics, giving a more nuanced view of employee engagement.

Geofence Security: Integrated location-based check-ins to ensure team presence within designated workspaces.

Bespoke Design System: A custom UI built on a "Forest & Cream" aesthetic, utilizing glassmorphism, super-rounded containers, and premium typography to reduce "dashboard fatigue."

Key Technical Modules
Admin Command Center: Deep-dive analytics into compliance metrics and streamlined leave approval workflows.

Employee Self-Service Portal: A comprehensive suite for tracking personal leave balances, submitting AI-verified documentation, and reviewing engagement scores.

Compliance & Engagement Log: A digital "Code of Engagement" that gamifies and standardizes professional expectations.

3. The Technical Snapshot (For Developers/Recruiters)
Tech Stack Focus: Frontend-heavy React/Next.js (implied) with sophisticated state management for complex dashboard views.

UI/UX: Custom CSS/Tailwind implementation of glassmorphism and a sophisticated natural color palette.

Key Features: Automated document parsing (AI), Geolocation API integration, and dynamic data visualization for "Pulse" metrics.
